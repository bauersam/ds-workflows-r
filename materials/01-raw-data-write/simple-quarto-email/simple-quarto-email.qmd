Some of the content in this document makes its way to the rendered HTML
and some of it is destined for a custom email message. The 'email' block
customizes the subject and the body of the email message, while the
rendered HTML contains only this paragraph.

```{r}
# Optionally define a Boolean that will suppress email sending when FALSE
send_email <- sample(c("TRUE", "FALSE"), 1)
```

:::: email

::: email-scheduled
<!-- An optional block that suppresses email sending when evaluated as "FALSE" -->
